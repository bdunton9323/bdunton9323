My name is Ben. I have been writing code professionally since 2010. 
I mainly write Java code at work, so that is what I am most familiar with. I also know C++ and Python well.

My repositories contain some of the projects that I am most proud of.

Interests:
- design patterns
- algorithms
- clean code
- automation

I love figuring out how things work, any why things are the way they are.

I am also an avid cyclist and live music enthusiast.
